The wagonSim contribution allows one to use MATSim's route-optimization process to find the optimal paths for rail based freight wagons on a given rail based freight infrastructure.

In this case, the network links define the rails, the nodes define the train stations and the schedule transit stops defines the train station stopping points. Freight locomotives drives on a strictly fixed schedule where each locomotive is given as a single transit line with a single transit route and a single departure. The freight wagons are the agents with a given origin and destination (single trip agents). Routing takes various constraints into account. i.e. a minimum shunting time while switching locomotives, maximum weight and length of a freight train and it differentiates between locomotive stops for shunting and stops for just waiting (without the possibility for shunting).
