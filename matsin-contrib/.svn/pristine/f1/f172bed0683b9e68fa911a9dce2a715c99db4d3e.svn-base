/**
 * This class tests the pt simulation of MATSim for a simple network created with CreateTestNetwork.java.
 * It checks the values of pt distances and times from the pt matrix for this network.
 * 
 * MATSim always calculates the total pt time and distance respectively between origin and destination facility as a sum of the following three values:
 * 	1.	the walk time and distance respectively from the origin facility to the nearest pt stop,
 * 	2.	the pt time and distance respectively between this origin pt stop and the destination pt stop, which is the nearest one from the destination facility,
 * 	3.	the walk time and distance respectively from this destination pt stop to the destination facility.
 * 
 * MATSim offers to possibilities to use pt simulation, which differ in the information you have to provide:
 * 	1.	The calculation of pt times and distances only from the information about the coordinates of pt stops and facilities.
 * 		For this calculation the euclidean distance between the pt stops and a given pt speed is used.
 * 	2.	The pt simulation with the additional information about the pt times and distances between all possible pt stops.
 * 
 * The walk distances always are calculated as the euclidean distances between facilities and pt stops. The walk times corresponds to these distances for a given walk speed.
 * 
 * In our test network the euclidean distance between a facility and its nearest pt stop is always 50 m. So the total walk distance always is 100 m.
 * If origin and destination pt stop coincide, the agents still have to walk via the pt stop to their destination. Even if origin and destination facility are the same.
 * Moreover there are four pt stops ordered as a square with an euclidean distance of 180 m as the distance between to neighboring pt stops.
 * There are four facilities, each corresponding to one of the four pt stop.
 * The distance between to facilities is always bigger than the distance between their corresponding pt stops. So the euclidean distance between to facilities is an upper bound for the distance between to pt stops.
