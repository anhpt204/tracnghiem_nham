\section*{Note}

The material found in this document was originally maintained as a web page. The html was automatically converted to latex, and incrementally cleaned up since then.  

As a result, leftovers from those web pages can still be found in the document, including lots of links to web pages which could be replaced by internal links in the document, and links to web pages where the material should be inlined into the document.
