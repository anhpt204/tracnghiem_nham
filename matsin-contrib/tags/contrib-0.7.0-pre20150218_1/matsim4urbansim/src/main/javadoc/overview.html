The adapter to use MATSim as a travel model plug-in to <a href="www.urbansim.org">UrbanSim</a>.
<p/>
The current travel model plug-in implementation is applicable for PSRC (Puget Sound Region Council) parcel, Seattle parcel and Zurich parcel scenario.  It was also used for a Brussels zone scenario.  Other scenarios may work or not.
<p/>
This module has not been maintained since 2013 and it is unclear how much of it still works.  
<p/>
For more information, see <a href="http://matsim.org/docs/extensions/matism4urbansim">here</a> and the javadoc.
