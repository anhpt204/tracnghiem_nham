Sebastian Schneider has done a Ph.D. dissertation about generating freight vehicle chains by essentially re-sampling the information contained in the German survey KiD.  Since the KiD is essentially an activity-based travel diary, the method should also be applicable to other situations.
<p/>
Since Sebastian has left science for the time being, he allowed me to take his code and integrate it into the repository, under the GPL. For the time being, it will just "sit" here until someone attempts to make it work.

More documentation, if any, may be in the javadoc. Otherwise, one will have to read the code itself.
