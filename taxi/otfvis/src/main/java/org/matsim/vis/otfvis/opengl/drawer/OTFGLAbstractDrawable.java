/**
 * History:<ul>
 * <li> There used to be an "OTFGLDrawableImpl implements OTFOGLDrawable".
 * This class here is replacing both the Impl (which was abstract anyway) and the interface (which was only used for this
 * one abstract implementation.
 * <li> An advantage of making this abstract instead of an interface is that onDraw can remain protected, only exposing
 * draw() as the true public interfaces (as it should be as far as I can currently see).
 * <li> There used to be an "isValid" but as far as I could tell it did not do anything.
