DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary 
algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.

DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing 
of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It 
works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanism such as multiprocessing 
and SCOOP (http://scoop.googlecode.com/).
