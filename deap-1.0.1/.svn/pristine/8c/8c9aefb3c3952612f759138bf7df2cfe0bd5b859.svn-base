Description: DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
        wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
        rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary 
        algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.
        
        DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing 
        of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It 
        works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanism such as multiprocessing 
        and SCOOP (http://scoop.googlecode.com/).
